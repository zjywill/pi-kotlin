# Migration TODO

Last reviewed: July 29, 2026

## Completion gate

- Source repository: `/Users/junyizhang/Git/pi`
- Reviewed source commit: `4f0437e2d58d651dd934119ecabea2893975f62f`
- Target repository: `/Users/junyizhang/Git/pi-kotlin`
- The migration is complete only when:

  ```bash
  ./migration/audit-migration.sh full
  ```

  exits successfully and every judge in `migration/RULEBOOK.md` passes against
  the same source commit.

The latest implementation stage carries extension registrations across the
out-of-process boundary even when they occur after the originating command has
returned. The Node host queues out-of-band actions and registration versions;
the Kotlin host receives them through a dedicated stdout reader, applies
provider mutations in order, and refreshes tool, command, and flag metadata. A
shared fixture schedules tool, command, flag, and provider registration from
`setTimeout`, then invokes the new tool and command on both runtimes.
`./gradlew clean test installDist` passes with 353 tests, all 17 deterministic
migration oracles pass, and the installed CLI/server distributions expose the
background command and provider. The sync audit reaches `4f0437e2`; the full
audit remains nonzero on the seven partial areas listed below.

## Next stage

Close the remaining extension-host loading gap: jiti-complete TypeScript
transpilation and import compatibility. Keep blocking TUI interruption,
shortcuts/renderers/custom UI, and the other six global partial areas as
separately audited slices.

Evidence for the completed background registration stage:

- [x] Tool, command, flag, and provider registration after the scheduling
      command response has completed
- [x] Ordered background provider action delivery before registration refresh
- [x] Invocation of the asynchronously registered tool and command
- [x] RPC discovery of the asynchronously registered command and provider
- [x] New tool activation and system-prompt refresh before the next prompt
- [x] Updated extension-runtime TypeScript/Kotlin oracle
- [x] Three repeated race-focused background test runs
- [x] `pi-coding-agent` with 130 tests and no failures, errors, or skips
- [x] `./gradlew clean test installDist` with 353 tests and no failures,
      errors, or skips
- [x] All 17 deterministic migration oracles
- [x] Installed `pi` discovers `background-command` and
      `background-provider/background-model` after `/schedule-background`
- [x] Installed `pi-server` spawn, background registration discovery, command
      invocation, status, stop, and removed-instance read-back
- [x] `./migration/audit-migration.sh sync` through `4f0437e2`
- [x] `./migration/audit-migration.sh full` confirms exactly seven remaining
      partial areas
